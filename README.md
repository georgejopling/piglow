# piglow

This repository contains some Python examples I have written for the PiGlow.

The PiGlow is a small add on board for the Raspberry Pi that provides 18 individually controllable LEDs.

pelican_crossing.py - simulates the operation of a pelican road crossing.
3way_junction.py - simulates the operation of a 3 way traffic light controlled road junction.

The code is commented for educational use.
